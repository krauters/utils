# Scripts

This folder contains reusable TypeScript scripts intended for pre-commit checks and other automation tasks, designed to be used across multiple repositories.

## Purpose

- **Centralized Automation:** Provides a consistent way to enforce checks, such as version validation, before committing changes.
- **Ease of Integration:** Ensures all consuming repositories maintain uniform pre-commit behavior.

## Key Script

- **`pre-commit.ts`**: This script handles pre-commit checks (like version validation). Itâ€™s meant to be executed via a bash script.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```
    npm install --save-dev @krauters/utils ts-node
    ```
2. **Set Up Your Pre-Commit Hook**:
   - Use a bash script to call `/scripts/pre-commit/index.sh` (or other specific scripst) in your repo.

   ```sh
   . ./node_modules/@krauters/utils/scripts/pre-commit/index.sh
   ```
